Project Title: Microservice-based Online Shopping Application Backend

Project Description:
The Microservice-based Online Shopping Application Backend is a robust and scalable system built using Spring Boot, implementing a microservices architecture. This project aims to provide a seamless online shopping experience to users by utilizing various cutting-edge technologies and design patterns.

Key Features:

Microservice Architecture: The backend is designed as a collection of loosely coupled microservices, each responsible for specific functionalities such as product management, user authentication, order processing, and more. This architecture enables independent development, deployment, and scalability of individual services.

Discovery Service: To facilitate service discovery and load balancing, a Discovery Service will be implemented using technologies like Eureka or Consul. This ensures that services can dynamically discover and communicate with each other as the application scales.

OAuth using Keycloak: User authentication and authorization will be secured using Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management solution. Keycloak provides robust security features, single sign-on capabilities, and token-based authentication for enhanced user data protection.

Distributed Tracing using Zipkin: To maintain visibility and monitor the performance of microservices, distributed tracing using Zipkin will be integrated. This will help in identifying bottlenecks and optimizing the application's overall response time.

Circuit Breakers: Circuit breakers will be implemented to prevent cascading failures within the system. When a service experiences a fault or becomes unresponsive, the circuit breaker will temporarily stop sending requests, avoiding overload and improving the application's fault tolerance.

Event-Driven Architecture with Apache Kafka and WebFlux: To enable asynchronous communication between services and support real-time data processing, an event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka will be employed. This allows for the publication and consumption of events, ensuring that different services can communicate efficiently without direct dependencies.
